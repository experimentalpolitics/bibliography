  comment       = {overview:
- The main question is the impact of factual information compared to framing effects in opinion formation. This is examined in the context of two emergent technologies: carbon-nanotubes and genetically modified foods.
- The authors hypothesize that facts will not have a significantly greater impact than frames without factual information. There are other hypotheses predicting various motivated reasoning effects stemming from the initial framing of the technologies.
- An experiment was administered that assigned several different combinations of frames and facts. A follow-up test was administered at a later date to test the hypotheses concerning motivated reasoning.
- Results indicate that “facts do not enhance frame strength” (p. 681). There is also evidence of biased processing once individuals form their initial opinions.
- Question: Is it possible to present frames without any factual content?
- Question: Is there a first-mover advantage when it comes to framing issues or events?},

  comment   = {Overview:
- natural experiment + survey on Greek islands affected by influx of refugees from Turkey -> distance from Turkey as instrument for refugee exposure
- "direct exposure to refugee arrivals insuces increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies"
- "since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility"

Method:
- Natural experiment comparing Greek islands that were exposed to refugees vs. islands that were not; distance to Turkish coast was used as an instrument to solve endogeneity issues
- identical survey (N ca. 2000) conducted on multiple islands asking for attitudes, policy preferences and political engagement (multiple items for certain categories combined via PCA), conducted well after refugees left
- 2SLS + various robustness and placebo tests, the analyses seem pretty solid
- potential mechanisms: natives affected by tourism (no) effects determined by predisposition (no, they're pretty uniform)  

Comments:
- in their argument, endogeneity is based on the refugees' decision where to land (i.e., in more "friendly" territory), which does not seem like the only source of endogeneity
- I'm not sure if I buy their argument that the findings challenge economic and cultural explanations. The authors suggest a clear distinction b/w these previous theories and the threat from passing refugees, which I find less clear than they suggest
- are there other factors related to distance & refugee attitudes which might confound the relationship? I thought so, but the placebo tests (comparing pre-exposure islands) suggest otherwise
- literature review might be useful, e.g., when they discuss how contact b/w ingroups and outgroups can reduce prejudice if both share equal status and common goals, find themselves in a cooperative rather than competitive environment, and operate under a well-defined set of norms or regulations. Also arguments regarding the role of knowledge, perspective-taking, etc. -> proximity does not necessarily lead to contact!},

- seven original survey experiments (various US samples) that "randomly assign respondents to receive or not receive accurate information about the prevalence of immigrants before reporting attitudes about immigrants and immigration policy"

- finding is not consistent with theories of power or intergroup threat (they argue it doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the theory itself, but rather suggests that there may be other cognitive mechanisms that explain why people perceive an out-group as threatening)

  abstract = {Even if people acknowledge that misinformation is incorrect after a correction has been presented, their feelings towards the source of the misinformation can remain unchanged. The current study investigated whether participants reduce their support of Republican and Democratic politicians when the prevalence of misinformation disseminated by the politicians appears to be high in comparison to the prevalence of their factual statements. We presented U.S. participants either with (1) equal numbers of false and factual statements from political candidates or (2) disproportionately more false than factual statements. Participants received fact-checks as to whether items were true or false, then rerated both their belief in the statements as well as their feelings towards the candidate. Results indicated that when corrected misinformation was presented alongside equal presentations of affirmed factual statements, participants reduced their belief in the misinformation but did not reduce their feelings towards the politician. However, if there was considerably more misinformation retracted than factual statements affirmed, feelings towards both Republican and Democratic figures were reduced—although the observed effect size was extremely small.},
  comment  = {overview:
- misinfo can be corrected, but attitudes don't change unless there is considerable more (fact-checked) misinformation than affirmed factual statements (even then effects are small) -> ratio of misinfo/factual matters
- overall, there appears to be mostly symmetry in how supporters of Trump vs. Sanders react (e.g., both are not able to differentiate between factual statement and misinfo prior to receiving the fact-check, although it should be noted that the Sanders-misinfo is qualitatively different from Trump-misinfo). But: supporters of Trump believed significantly more in Trump misinformation than non-supporters, even after receiving corrective info.
- corrective misinformation did not change participants' view of a politician's general veracity, they are bad at keeping a running tally of inaccuracies

design:
- experiment showing actual statements by Trump/Sanders (some factual, some misinfo), varied the ratio of factual vs. misinfo statements
- atttitudes / beliefs measured pre and post fact-check
- supporter/non-supporter distinction based on feeling-thermometer split
- 2(ratio manipulation)x2(Trump/Sanders)x2(Supporter/non-supporter)x2(pre/post fact check) between-within design
- sample: 1,500 MTurk respondents

comments/questions:
- shows useful examples of how to present corrective information for future experimental designs
- analysis clearly done by psychologist, lots of ANOVAs with three-way interactions
- Q: this study focuses on change in feeling towards source (i.e., the politician making false statement) rather than the change in feeling towards the target (i.e., the object the false statement is about, c.f., Hopkins 2019 JOP). Important difference?},
