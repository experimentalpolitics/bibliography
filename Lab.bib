	Comment = {overview: - The main question is the impact of factual information compared to framing effects in opinion formation. This is examined in the context of two emergent technologies: carbon-nanotubes and genetically modified foods. - The authors hypothesize that facts will not have a significantly greater impact than frames without factual information. There are other hypotheses predicting various motivated reasoning effects stemming from the initial framing of the technologies. - An experiment was administered that assigned several different combinations of frames and facts. A follow-up test was administered at a later date to test the hypotheses concerning motivated reasoning. - Results indicate that ``facts do not enhance frame strength'' (p. 681). There is also evidence of biased processing once individuals form their initial opinions. - Question: Is it possible to present frames without any factual content? - Question: Is there a first-mover advantage when it comes to framing issues or events?},

	Comment = {Overview: - natural experiment + survey on Greek islands affected by influx of refugees from Turkey -> distance from Turkey as instrument for refugee exposure - "direct exposure to refugee arrivals insuces increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies" - "since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility" Method: - Natural experiment comparing Greek islands that were exposed to refugees vs. islands that were not; distance to Turkish coast was used as an instrument to solve endogeneity issues - identical survey (N ca. 2000) conducted on multiple islands asking for attitudes, policy preferences and political engagement (multiple items for certain categories combined via PCA), conducted well after refugees left - 2SLS + various robustness and placebo tests, the analyses seem pretty solid - potential mechanisms: natives affected by tourism (no) effects determined by predisposition (no, they're pretty uniform) Comments: - in their argument, endogeneity is based on the refugees' decision where to land (i.e., in more "friendly" territory), which does not seem like the only source of endogeneity - I'm not sure if I buy their argument that the findings challenge economic and cultural explanations. The authors suggest a clear distinction b/w these previous theories and the threat from passing refugees, which I find less clear than they suggest - are there other factors related to distance & refugee attitudes which might confound the relationship? I thought so, but the placebo tests (comparing pre-exposure islands) suggest otherwise - literature review might be useful, e.g., when they discuss how contact b/w ingroups and outgroups can reduce prejudice if both share equal status and common goals, find themselves in a cooperative rather than competitive environment, and operate under a well-defined set of norms or regulations. Also arguments regarding the role of knowledge, perspective-taking, etc. -> proximity does not necessarily lead to contact!},

Method: - survey experiment (estimate foreign born X correct info) - DV: attitudes towards immigrants, econ/culture threat Finding: - correct info doesn't change attitudes but corrects guess -> misperception of amount is consequence rather than cause of atittudes Limitations: - just giving info is not enough, different framing might be more effective comments/questions: - good literature review, check some of their citations/discussion of previous results!},

	Abstract = {Even if people acknowledge that misinformation is incorrect after a correction has been presented, their feelings towards the source of the misinformation can remain unchanged. The current study investigated whether participants reduce their support of Republican and Democratic politicians when the prevalence of misinformation disseminated by the politicians appears to be high in comparison to the prevalence of their factual statements. We presented U.S. participants either with (1) equal numbers of false and factual statements from political candidates or (2) disproportionately more false than factual statements. Participants received fact-checks as to whether items were true or false, then rerated both their belief in the statements as well as their feelings towards the candidate. Results indicated that when corrected misinformation was presented alongside equal presentations of affirmed factual statements, participants reduced their belief in the misinformation but did not reduce their feelings towards the politician. However, if there was considerably more misinformation retracted than factual statements affirmed, feelings towards both Republican and Democratic figures were reduced---although the observed effect size was extremely small.},

But: supporters of Trump believed significantly more in Trump misinformation than non-supporters, even after receiving corrective info. - corrective misinformation did not change participants' view of a politician's general veracity, they are bad at keeping a running tally of inaccuracies design: - experiment showing actual statements by Trump/Sanders (some factual, some misinfo), varied the ratio of factual vs. misinfo statements - atttitudes / beliefs measured pre and post fact-check - supporter/non-supporter distinction based on feeling-thermometer split - 2(ratio manipulation)x2(Trump/Sanders)x2(Supporter/non-supporter)x2(pre/post fact check) between-within design - sample: 1,500 MTurk respondents comments/questions: - shows useful examples of how to present corrective information for future experimental designs - analysis clearly done by psychologist, lots of ANOVAs with three-way interactions - Q: this study focuses on change in feeling towards source (i.e., the politician making false statement) rather than the change in feeling towards the target (i.e., the object the false statement is about, c.f., Hopkins 2019 JOP).

Method: - Survey asking respondents to complete 15 pairwise comparisons between public risks on multiple dimensions (priority, harm, mortality, fairness, responsibility, disaster potential, long-term growth, worry) - analysis based on aggregation of individual paired comparisons. Findings: - Respondents are well informed about (relatve) magnitude of risks, but those perceptions explained relatively little variation in policy preferences - Instead, what matters is the relative status of the victim and the appropriate role of government -> we need to distinguish between factual beliefs and policy preferences, key to productive discourse likely lies in understanding voters' values rather than contesting their factual beliefs. Comments/Questions: - Main priority measure seems problematic: More money than currently or more money than the other risk? The baseline is unclear! - Accurate relative risk perception does not necessarily imply accurate *absolute* risk perception...},

	Abstract = {We propose a model of motivated skepticism that helps explain when and why citizens are biased‐information processors. Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control, finding strong evidence of a prior attitude effect such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments. When reading pro and con arguments, participants (Ps) counterargue the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias. We also find a confirmation bias---the seeking out of confirmatory evidence---when Ps are free to self‐select the source of the arguments they read. Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization---the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes---especially among those with the strongest priors and highest levels of political sophistication. We conclude with a discussion of the normative implications of these findings for rational behavior in a democracy.},
	Author = {Charles S. Taber and Milton Lodge},
	Comment = {Takeaways: - Motivated skepticism: people usually accept presented information but begin to question when any contrary evidence is presented. It helps explain when and why there's biased-information process among citizens. - In the normative model, collecting and integrating information should be independent form prior belief. - However, people are more likely to accept/seeking supportive evidence while dismissing contrary evidence to their prior belief. Why? (RQ) - Theory of motivated political reasoning suggests two motives to reasoning : accuracy goal, and partisan goal (the latter usually considered to drive selective information process and affect-driven motivated reasoning) - Prior beliefs and attitudes impact on the evaluation of new information and information updating process : prior attitude effect, disconfirmation bias, and confirmation bias - Conditioning on attitudes strength and sophistication level, disconfirmation bias and confirmation bias lead attitude polarization. attitudes are more lilkey to be strengthening among those with the stronger priors and higher levels of political sophistication. Questions/Comment: - These experiments are about evaluation of argument (info) not really about Ps' own attitude changes - Need to test how credibility of info source affect on changes in their attitudes. Strength of prior attitudes and sophistication may be entangled},

	Comment = {overview: - analysis of multiple CCES waves (2006-2014), examines the effect of women candidates and officeholders on political knowledge, interest, and participation - main argument: most evidence of the effect of descriptive representation on women's empowerment is drawn from surveys from the 1980s and 1990s - knoweldge: "both men and women are more politically knowledgeable when represented by women in Congress and in state government." - engagement: "little evidence that women are more politically interested or participatory when residing in places with more female officeholders or candidates" -> descriptive representation has modest effects on political knowledge among other women, but little unique benefit specifically for women as gender gaps are not reduced -> little effect on women's interest or engagement in politics -> potential explanation: changing trends in how people view gender in campaigns, not particularly salient to how women approach campaigns questions/comments: - some useful arguments why we should not expect large effects of descriptive representation in current surveys (as compared to past studies) - to me, the fact that men are similarly affected by women officeholders than men suggests that there might be some underlying confounding factor that is associated with the likelihood of women candidates},

@article{clifford2018disgust,
	Abstract = {Abstract Emotions feature prominently in political rhetoric and media frames, and they have potent effects on how people process information. Yet, existing research has largely overlooked the influence of disgust, which is a basic emotion that leads people to avoid contamination threats. We illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions influence political engagement in different ways. This study investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to seek additional information. Thus, disgust has the counterintuitive effect of decreasing public engagement in precisely those situations where it is most critical.},

	Abstract = {Disagreements over whether polarization exists in the mass public have confounded two separate types of polarization. When social polarization is separated from issue position polarization, both sides of the polarization debate can be simultaneously correct. Social polarization, characterized by increased levels of partisan bias, activism, and anger, is increasing, driven by partisan identity and political identity alignment, and does not require the same magnitude of issue position polarization. The partisan-ideological sorting that has occurred in recent decades has caused the nation as a whole to hold more aligned political identities, which has strengthened partisan identity and the activism, bias, and anger that result from strong identities, even though issue positions have not undergone the same degree of polarization. The result is a nation that agrees on many things but is bitterly divided nonetheless. An examination of ANES data finds strong support for these hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Political ideology is not always best measured along a unidimensional spectrum. With a multidimensional construct, we are better able to understand the complexities of Americans{\"\i}¿½ ideological views. This research note presents new survey data from a nationally representative sample of over 2,000 Americans. The survey asks respondents to place themselves on distinct ideological scales regarding social and economic issues, then to prioritize the importance of these issues. The first of its kind to include both ideological preferences and attitude importance, this survey contributes new insights into the complex dimensionality of ideology. Results reveal a plurality of individuals identifying as conservative on both social and economic issues, and a smaller group that is consistently liberal on both policy spectrums. Eleven percent of respondents self-identify as liberal on one scale and conservative on the other, yet choose to identify as {\"\i}¿½moderate{\"\i}¿½ on the traditional unidimensional scale. By analyzing an extensive set of attitudinal and behavioral measures-including vote choice in the 2012 presidential election-this research demonstrates that true moderates are substantially different from those who mix both social and economic beliefs. It further shows that the vast majority of Americans place more importance on economic issues than on social issues, which has greater influence over respondents{\"\i}¿½ unidimensional ideological placement as well as their presidential vote choice. This study reveals important consequences of the multidimensional nature of ideology at the mass level.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening procedure in a third study. Our results suggest that these fraudulent respondents provide unusually low-quality data, but can be easily identified and screened out. An example of how we combat this in our study is that we use VPN in our study to make sure respondents are in the United States.},

Essentially, these decisions reflect attempts to align the attention of individuals already disposed for conflict." - "The primary function of fringe beliefs is thus not epistemic but social: They serve as a signal to others about your allegiances." - interesting example: moral principles as a propaganda tactic that also facilitates coordination -> propaganda is about coordination, not manipulation (which is generally ineffective since psychological designs that guard against manipulation should create fitness advantages)! comments/questions: - very useful review to think about fake news in a broader framework, check citations in the article! - overall argument is appealing, but needs further empirical validation.

Zaller thinks that instead of people being absent of opinion, people are really filled with lots of differing and contrasting opinions and whichever ones are made salient are those most likely to be expressed (which can make it look like people have unstable attitudes). The first half of this book is dedicated to the nature and structure of opinions, while the second half is devoted to exploring how those opinions can change (persuasion techniques). Zaller concludes that attitudes are not directly retrieved from memory, but rather are constructed through priming, salience, the environment, etc. The RAS (Receive Accept Sample) model of forming/displaying attitudes has four axioms: Reception (predispositions towards an issue), Resistance (political sophistication/awareness), Accessibility (salience), Response (average of salient considerations). Also note that the more aware (i.e., sophisticated) you are regarding an issue the more consistency you will show in your expressed attitudes about that issue.},

	Comment = {overview: - dynamic information board experiment - tipping point: degree of incongruent information at which motivated reasoning is replaced by more accurate processing and belief reversal - motivated reasoning and affective intelligence as two contrasting mechanisms - with low degrees of incongruent information, individuals behave as motivated reasoners -> bolster their prior attitude - more incongruent information -> anxiety -> affective intelligence -> more balanced processing -> belief reversal - abundance of incongruent information leads to anxiety which in turn decreases motivated reasoning and counterarguing of information that contradicts the individuals' prior attitudes -> affect towards a known candidate is an important factor to the extent accurate information is perceived. Voters may become even more positive to a candidate they like upon learning something negative. There is a point where tipping of attitudes occurs ============================================================================ overview: - Small amounts of disconfirming evidence tend to either be discounted or lead to attitude strengthening. This paper examines whether there is a level of disconfirming evidence beyond which motivated reasoning effects are overwhelmed and belief updating occurs. - Affective intelligence drives the proposed ``tipping point'' effect. Motivated reasoning is typically a subconscious system 1 process. Continual exposure to disconfirming evidence, however, causes anxiety, which eventually causes system 2 deliberative processes to activate. At this point, disconfirming evidence results in ``rational'' belief updating. - The authors conduct a dynamic process tracing experiment to test this. The key manipulation is the proportion of disconfirming evidence concerning one's favored candidate. - Results show that once disconfirming evidence reaches levels of about 28% and beyond, rational belief updating begins to occur. - Question: Does the presence of other acceptable candidates influence where the affective tipping point lies? - Question: Is there a role for priors in determining how much disconfirming information is needed to induce corrective belief updating? ============================================================================ overview: - Starting point: Motivated reasoners perceive and evaluate negative information about a preferred candidate in a biased way and become even more supportive of their candidate (theory of motivated reasoning). - RQ 1: Is there a limit to this process? Is there a tipping point where motivated reasoners stop being immune to disconfirming information and start updating their candidate evaluation more accurately? - RQ 2: On which mechanism is this tipping working? Theory: - The theory of motivated reasoning explains why we do not update correctly. - The theory on affective intelligence explains why we do update correctly: because we become anxious in face of incongruent information we think harder and update our evaluations correctly. - We have empirical evidence for both phenomena: attitude strengthening effects despite being exposed to disconfirming evidence as well as accurately updating an existing evaluation as the new evidence would suggest. Hence, those two theories are not mutually exclusive, but supplement each other: which of these theories (mechanisms) is working is a specific case depends on the amount of disconfirming evidence. When the amount of disconfirming information is small, individuals engage in motivated reasoning, when the Hypotheses: 1: Initially, as more disconfirming information about a preferred candidate is encountered, the positive evaluation of the candidate becomes stronger (motivated reasoning). 2: The motivated reasoning does not work infinitely, there exists a tipping point. The tipping point is reached at a certain amount of disconfirming information. 3: The mechanism that leads to accurate updating beyond the tipping point is affective intelligence (the biased recipient becomes anxious (=less certain) of whether the preferred candidate is really to be preferred and engages in more active information seeking and more accurate updating). Empirical analysis (supporting Hypos): Experiment, in which subjects seek for information about a preferred candidate on an information board. Questionnaires at the beginning, in between and at the end. Hypo 1 & 2: Treatment (x) is the probability of encountering negative information on a preferred candidate. Outcome (y) is the correct updating (vs. incorrect updating) of the candidate preference as measured by the questionnaires in between and at the end. Hypo 3: measurement of affective intelligence via questionnaire: (i) difficulty of vote choice, (ii) certainty of having chosen the ``right'' candidate, (iii) Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) to assess subject's affective state. Up to the tipping point, the reported difficulty increases and confidence decreases, beyond the tipping point it is the reverse. Individuals who had a greater probability of encountering negative information have more negative affective state after casting vote than control group who received no negative information. ============================================================================ The Background: Motivated reasoning tells us that even when people encounter information contrary to their prior beliefs, they maintain their current beliefs. Sometimes they even assert their current beliefs more strongly and basically ``reason'' away the contrary information. The Question: Do motivated reasoners ever give up and change with contrary information? The Theory: They post that with a small amount of contrary information motivated reasoning will hold, but when subjects see larger amounts of negative information (i.e. information contradicting their viewpoint) they will begin to get anxious. Anxiety will lead them to more information seeking and more careful processing. This will lead to opinion change. The Method: They use the information board, which simulates a campaign environment. They vary the amounts of contradictory information subjects are exposed to. Findings: They track exposure (i.e. the percentage of contrary information subjects could have clicked on) and actual viewing (how much information they actually read/saw). The percentage of contrary information viewed before changes is relatively lower- like 20%. Critical Thoughts: This doesn't contradict motivated reasoning. In fact it can be viewed as just further exploring the online tally. There are potential issues with the external/internal validity of the information board -- i.e. they don't control who clicks what and not everyone is a motivated reasoner, but that is a minor issue (subjects didn't know before clicking whether an article would be agreeing or contradictory, which also helps). The anxiety part of the theory relies on affective intelligence and other papers like Valentino et. al 2008 (see cognition notes) that posit that anxiety actually promotes information seeking and efficient information processing, but this view is contested. Anxiety might motivate information seeking, but in some studies it inhibits processing (Huddy et. al 2005). At the same time, the anxiety ``link'' in the theory isn't essential to the findings.},

	Abstract = {As an institution, the American news media have become highly unpopular in recent decades. Yet, we do not thoroughly understand the consequences of this unpopularity for mass political behavior. While several existing studies find that media trust moderates media effects, they do not examine the consequences of this for voting. This paper explores those consequences by analyzing voting behavior in the 2004 presidential election. It finds, consistent with most theories of persuasion and with studies of media effects in other contexts, that media distrust leads voters to discount campaign news and increasingly rely on their partisan predispositions as cues. This suggests that increasing aggregate levels of media distrust are an important source of greater partisan voting.},

	Abstract = {This analysis studies how variation in individuals' motivation to form accurate judgments affects the process of political discussion. I use a small‐group experiment in which participants compete to elect the simulated candidate who best represents their true preferences. I manipulate economic incentives to control participants' accuracy motivations. The results show that accuracy‐motivated participants, compared to those with weaker accuracy goals, seek discussants with more expertise and a more diverse set of viewpoints, place greater emphasis on socially provided messages, and reduce emphasis on political predispositions. As a result of these differences, however, accuracy‐motivated participants rely more heavily on biased information. Hence, accuracy motivations do not produce more accurate judgments or better decisions. Although previous work on political discussion has largely ignored the role of motivations, these results suggest that accuracy motivations play an important but nuanced role in this process. Strengthened accuracy motivations increase individuals' exposure to political expertise and ideological diversity but also increase their potential to be misled.},

Experts tend to evaluate the credibility of polls based on the survey methods used, vendor track record, and data transparency, but it is unclear if the public does the same. In two different experimental studies---one focusing on candidate evaluations in the 2016 U.S. election and one on a policy issue---we find a significant factor in respondent assessments of polling credibility to be the poll results themselves. Respondents viewed polls as more credible when majority opinion matched their opinion. Moreover, we find evidence of attitude polarization after viewing polling results, suggesting motivated reasoning in the evaluations of political polls. These findings indicate that evaluations of polls are biased by motivated reasoning and suggest that such biases could constrain the possible impact of polls on political decision making.},

@article{Pennycook2019fighting,
	Abstract = {Many people consume news via social media. It is therefore desirable to reduce social media users{\textquoteright} exposure to low-quality news content. One possible intervention is for social media ranking algorithms to show relatively less content from sources that users deem to be untrustworthy. But are laypeople{\textquoteright}s judgments reliable indicators of quality, or are they corrupted by either partisan bias or lack of information? Perhaps surprisingly, we find that laypeople{\textemdash}on average{\textemdash}are quite good at distinguishing between lower- and higher-quality sources. These results indicate that incorporating the trust ratings of laypeople into social media ranking algorithms may prove an effective intervention against misinformation, fake news, and news content with heavy political bias.Reducing the spread of misinformation, especially on social media, is a major challenge. We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content ({\textquotedblleft}fake news{\textquotedblright}). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans{\textemdash}mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans{\textemdash}every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media.},

	Abstract = {A key characteristic of democratic politics is competition between groups, first of all political parties. Yet, the unavoidably partisan nature of political conflict has had too little influence on scholarship on political psychology. Despite more than 50 years of research on political parties and citizens, we continue to lack a systematic understanding of when and how political parties influence public opinion. We suggest that alternative approaches to political parties and public opinion can be best reconciled and examined through a richer theoretical perspective grounded in motivated reasoning theory. Clearly, parties shape citizens' opinions by mobilizing, influencing, and structuring choices among political alternatives. But the answer to when and how parties influence citizens' reasoning and political opinions depends on an interaction between citizens' motivations, effort, and information generated from the political environment (particularly through competition between parties). The contribution of motivated reasoning, as we describe it, is to provide a coherent theoretical framework for understanding partisan influence on citizens' political opinions. We review recent empirical work consistent with this framework. We also point out puzzles ripe for future research and discuss how partisan‐motivated reasoning provides a useful point of departure for such work.},

Nonetheless, a longstanding concern is that partisan identification slants decision-making.

We identify two politically relevant factors that condition partisan motivated reasoning: (1) an explicit inducement to form an ``accurate'' opinion, and (2) cross-partisan, but not consensus, bipartisan support for the law. We further provide evidence of how partisan motivated reasoning works psychologically and affects opinion strength.

It further argues that the nature of this biased processing will be such that partisans devalue information inconsistent with their partisan affect. Using a pair of experiments, I test these hypotheses by manipulating both objective evidence concerning gubernatorial responsibility for a state's fiscal imbalance and the presence of partisan cues.

	Abstract = {Basic assumptions of dual-process theories are used to explain the process of credibility attribution. Three experiments test the assumption that high task involvement leads to intensive processing of content information, whereas low task involvement leads to the use of noncontent information like source cues when people make credibility judgments. In Experiment 1, as predicted, when task involvement is low, only source attractiveness influences credibility attributions; when task involvement is high, content information also influences credibility attributions. Experiments 2 and 3 replicate these results with different source cue and message content manipulations. These findings demonstrate the fruitfulness of applying basic assumptions of dual-process theories to the field of deceptive communication research. Practical implications for forensic credibility assessment are outlined.},

	Abstract = {<p> In this article, we explore whether incongruent information influences what people recall to mind about a presidential candidate's policy statements. We investigate whether the volume of people's political thoughts, their ability to produce arguments, the affective valence of these thoughts, and their integrative complexity are influenced by the congruency between new political information and prior political convictions. We conducted an experiment via MTurk manipulating the congruency of information with respect to ideology. Our results show that incongruency significantly alters how people think about politics. Incongruent information increases integrative complexity of the opposing thoughts, becomes more voluminous, and includes more rationales. Moreover, these defensive thoughts are significantly more negative and less positive about the incongruent information. Parallel to what studies on motivated reasoning demonstrated, we also find that politically knowledgeable people...},

	Abstract = {Motivated reasoning is a pervasive force in politics. The concept of motivated reasoning was developed and elaborated in both psychology and economics as a way of understanding the way in which people learn and respond to information, and as a mechanism to explain behavior that is seen as less than optimal. It has been important in political science since the early 2000s. Political scientists initially connected the distinct constructs of motivated reasoning with online information processing, given the affective, unconscious, and automatic bases of both processes, but they later distinguished cognitive effort and processing style from underlying goals or motivation. Most research on motivated reasoning in political science focuses on two primary motivations: accuracy and directional goals. An accuracy motivation is defined by reasoning that seeks to arrive at a conclusion that is free from error given the information at hand, whereas a directional goal is defined by a desire to protect one's existing beliefs or identities. Much of the early research on motivated reasoning in political science painted citizens as incapable of evaluating in- formation objectively, and, to make matters worse, citizens' processing biases appeared to increase with political knowledge, interest, and the strength of existing political beliefs. A second generation of research on motivated reasoning identified individual-level and contextual factors that moderated or eliminated directional biases. Scholars devel- oped a better understanding of how motivations rooted in partisan identity affect informa- tion interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making, as well how different information environments can shift the motivations that citizens pursue when they are reasoning about politics. The pursuit of an accuracy motivation in political reasoning is now considered a realistic and attainable standard for evaluating citizen competence in democratic soci- eties that avoids many of the pitfalls of past attempts to define the quality of citizens' reasoning capacities.},

To assess the bias introduced by information effects, I compare ``fully informed{''} collective preferences simulated from actual survey data to collective preferences revealed in the original data. Analysis of policy questions from the 1988 and 1992 American National Election Studies shows that group differences in knowledge, along with the public's modest average level of political knowledge, cart cause significant distortions in measures of collective opinion. The mass public may appear more progressive on some issues and more conservative on others than would be the case if all citizens were equally well informed. To the extent that opinion polls influence democratic politics, this suggests that information effects can impair the responsiveness of governments to their citizens.},
  comment     = {overview:
- how would full information affect policy preferences of the electorate?
-> information effect as the bias in the shape of collective opinion caused by low levels and uneven distribution of political knowledge
-> deviations in representation based on sociodemographics/interests X knowledge
-> measure of collective/public opinion is biased, such that the public appears more progressive on some issues and more conservative on others
- results somewhat challenge the notion of rational collective preferences through on-line processing, heuristic shortcuts, and statistical aggregation as ways to overcome lack of political knowledge
- however, the information effects differ by policies and are not as profound as early studies on citizen incompetence might suggest (e.g. Converse etc)

data/methods:
- ANES 1988 and 1992
- simulate/impute collective policy preferences under hypothetical full information in the entire electorate -> see Bartels 1996, Delli Carpini/Keeter 1996
- imputation through modeling interactions b/w sociodemographic variables and political knowledge as determinants of policy preferences, simulate predicted values if knowledge was maximized for entire electorate

results:
- fully informed preferences are sometimes more liberal and sometimes more conservatie than actual preferences
- some asymmetries in representation due to lack of information are bigger than previous studies suggested, but deviations depend on the specific policy
- "The key contribution of this study lies not with speculating about the public's true interests but with demonstrating that survey results sometimes look the way they do because so many people are ill-informed about politics and because certain people tend to be better informed than others."

questions/comments:
- a little bit more skeptical than page and shapiro
- how consequential are the informational asymmetries in terms of policy outcomes?},

People who like news take advantage of abundant political information to become more knowledgeable and more likely to turn out. In contrast, people who prefer entertainment abandon the news and become less likely to learn about politics and go to the polls. To test this proposition, I develop a measure of people's media content preference and include it in a representative opinion survey of2,358 U.S. residents. Resultshow that content preference indeed becomes a better predictor of political knowledge and turnout as media choice increases.

- analyze web-browsing histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news (tracked through bing toolbar add-on in IE explorer)
- media slant is measured based on the outlet level not at the article level
- ideological segregation is defined as the expected difference in the conservative shares of news outlets visited by two randomly selected individuals (somewhat confusing)
- higher segregation is the result of individuals choosing only publications that are ideologically similar to each other, rarely reading opposing perspectives (rather than reading across the board while still having a left- or right-leaning preference)
- 4 consumption channels: direct, aggregator, social, search

main findings:
1) social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals (ideological segregation)
2) social networks and search engines are also associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum
3) the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets
-> evidence for both sides of the debate whether thechnological changes increase exposure to diverse perspective or create cho chambers!

limitations:
- news slant measured on outlet rather than article level
- focus on news consumption itself, not political behavior
- it is possible that stories that have the greates impact on such outcomes are disproportionately discovered via social networks or search engines
- study focused on subpopulation of active news consumers
- defining causation in this setting is a difficult issue

questions/comments:
- useful citation when discussing the existence of eco chambers and filter bubbles!
- great discussion of the procedures (e.g., to identify news and opinion articles, infreeing consumption channels through url history) + useful cites!
- media slant measure is problematic since regional variation in ideology is confounded by regional variation in education levels (see washington post)
- creative strategies (e.g., to estimate ideological slant based on regional variation in viewership)
- selection bias / lack of representativeness and measurement error are the two most important issues
- none of the plots or tables convey any sense of the uncertainty around the estimates!},

- question: is polarization a cause of media fragmentation or rather an effect fo media fragmentation? Causal direction is not completely clear in the literature
- major issue in past research: unable to disentangle the effect of selective exposure and actual persuasion
- Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) design, includes free choice and forced exposure of partisan media sources (Fox News, MSNBC, entertainment)
- design allows authors to estimate the degree of polarization caused by selective exposure and the persuasive effect of partisan media, as well as sensitivityanalyses accounting for discrepancies between stated preferences and actual choice
- exposire to more partisan news can sway opinions of even those respondents who are already exposed to some degree of partisan news, but they are most effective among respondents who usually prefer entertainment rather than partisan news
- "We ﬁnd that partisan media can polarize both its regular consumers and inadvertent audiences who would otherwise not consume it, but ideologically opposing media potentially also can ameliorate the existing polarization between consumers."
-> polarization is not simply a function of selective exposure, persuasion effects play an important role as well

comments/questions:
- interesting and useful article that can serve as a template for future persuasion/exposure studies
- design is almost the same as in our lab project implementing a randomized exposure + endogenous exposure design, but we keep the actual content of the news article constant, which could be an interesting extension
- one of their outcome measures is intention to share the news article, this could also be useful for the lab project},

- Assumption 3 is key (and strong in certain contexts), the framework allows for sensitivity analysis of its violation

questions/comments:
- no-design-effect assumption is important, our lab project essentially argues that a nominally identical treatment has different effects on the outcome for the same unit depending on whether the treatment was randomly assigned in the forced exposure condition or voluntary chosen in the free-choice condition -> Essentially we are arguing that this key assumption is violated, which would be an interesting methodological contribution.},

  title      = {Partisan Gaps in Political Information and Information-Seeking Behavior: Motivated Reasoning or Cheerleading?},
  year       = {2020},
  comment    = {overview:
- contrasting motivated reasoning vs. partisan cheerleading as explanations of political information gaps between partisans
- uses incentives for correct responses: "random assignment of incentives provides insight into the extent to which divides in factual beliefs are inﬂated by partisans knowingly providing incorrect, but party-congenial, answers to the questions"
- "ﬁndings support the motivated reasoning interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their party in a favorable light."

design (copy&paste):
1) randomly as- sign survey respondents to either receive or not receive incentives for correctly answering political knowledge questions.
2) respondents selected a news article on the topic to read
3) respondents answered the political information question and also indicated how conﬁdent they were
4) ability to observe the news consumption of some survey respondents outside the survey context

findings:
1) while incentives reduce partisan divides in information, substantial partisan gaps persist even when incentives are present
2) partisans seek out information from co-partisan media sources to the same extent whether incentives are available or not
3) the divides in information search we observe in the survey context mirror partisan divides in online news consumption registered by the same individuals outside the survey setting
-> "Overall, our ﬁndings support motivated reasoning rather than the cheerleading inter- pretation of partisan divides in information and information seeking behavior."

comments:
- useful review of recent research on misinformation, check again for cites and basic arguments
- e.g., "tendencies are complemented by a high-choice information environment that creates an opportunity for partisans to screen out uncongenial information"},

  year       = {2020},
  comment    = {overview:
- combines survey and web traffic data (YouGov Pulse sample) during the 2016 US presidential campaign
- outcomes of interest: exposure to untrustworthy websites

findings:
1) people diﬀerentially consume false information that reinforces their political view; Trump supporters were most likely to visit untrustworthy websites -> selective exposure
2) but: consumption of news from these sites was instead heavily concentrated among a small subset of people; these sites made up a small share of people’s information diets on average and were largely consumed by a subset of Americans with strong preferences for pro-attitudinal information
3) Facebook played a central role in spreading content from untrustworthy websites relative to other platforms
4) fact-checks of articles published by these outlets almost never reached their target audience
5) untrustworthy website consumption does not crowd out consumption of other hard news
- "These results suggest that widespread speculation about the prevalence of exposure to untrustworthy websites has been overstated." -> I disagree with this point


comments/questions:
- useful citations on selective exposure
- this is another example of downplaying the potential role of fake news in influencing the 2016 election. Argue that previous studies cannot show causal relationship but ignores a lot of issues with their own inference
- url-based approach does not capture fake-news exposure on social media (facebook etc) as long as respondents did not follow each link
- what about weak partisans vs. strong partisans?},

  title    = {Increasing Precision in Survey Experiments Without Introducing Bias},
  year     = {2020},
  comment  = {overview:
- most common design is the between-subjects design in which outcome is only measured post-treatment -> low precision, requires large sample sizes
- alternative designs that involve repeated mesurement of the DV promise greater precision but are rarely used out of fears that the design may bias treatment effects
- this paper shows results form 6 experiments manipulatign designs and shos that repeated measures designs substantially increase precision while introducing little to no bias
- within-subject designs also offer new insights into heterogeneous treatment effects
- interesting finding: most respondents forget their previous response and believe that their opinions did not change in pretest posttest even if they did
- only caveat: within-subject designs are limited to cases in which the effect of the independent variable can be removed
-> "Given the clear gains in precision and weak evidence for bias, we recommend that
researchers use prepost and within-subjects designs whenever possible."

experimental designs considered in the studies:
- posttest -> standard design
- prepost -> standard design + pre-treatment measure (same item)
- quasi-prepost -> standard design + pre-treatment measure (slightly altered item)
- within -> prepost + treatment before first measurement in control (i.e., every group recieves treatment, only ordering of treatments and measurements is varied)

potential sources for bias in repeated measures designs:
- demand effects -> little empirical evidence
- consistency pressures -> limited by subject's memory
- interaction between testing and the treatment -> little evidence?

comments / questions:
- paper also includes some useful discussion regarding the inclusion of covariates to increase precision (which it does, but the benefits are smaller than repeated measurement designs)
-> "While our quasi controls varied in their effectiveness across studies, overall the results suggest that carefully selected controls can substantially increase statistical power relative to standard controls for partisanship and ideology."},
