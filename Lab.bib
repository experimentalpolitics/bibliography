  comment       = {overview:
- The main question is the impact of factual information compared to framing effects in opinion formation. This is examined in the context of two emergent technologies: carbon-nanotubes and genetically modified foods.
- The authors hypothesize that facts will not have a significantly greater impact than frames without factual information. There are other hypotheses predicting various motivated reasoning effects stemming from the initial framing of the technologies.
- An experiment was administered that assigned several different combinations of frames and facts. A follow-up test was administered at a later date to test the hypotheses concerning motivated reasoning.
- Results indicate that “facts do not enhance frame strength” (p. 681). There is also evidence of biased processing once individuals form their initial opinions.
- Question: Is it possible to present frames without any factual content?
- Question: Is there a first-mover advantage when it comes to framing issues or events?},

  pages     = {1--14},
  comment   = {Overview:
- natural experiment + survey on Greek islands affected by influx of refugees from Turkey -> distance from Turkey as instrument for refugee exposure
- "direct exposure to refugee arrivals insuces increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies"
- "since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility"

Method:
- Natural experiment comparing Greek islands that were exposed to refugees vs. islands that were not; distance to Turkish coast was used as an instrument to solve endogeneity issues
- identical survey (N ca. 2000) conducted on multiple islands asking for attitudes, policy preferences and political engagement (multiple items for certain categories combined via PCA), conducted well after refugees left
- 2SLS + various robustness and placebo tests, the analyses seem pretty solid
- potential mechanisms: natives affected by tourism (no) effects determined by predisposition (no, they're pretty uniform)  

Comments:
- in their argument, endogeneity is based on the refugees' decision where to land (i.e., in more "friendly" territory), which does not seem like the only source of endogeneity
- I'm not sure if I buy their argument that the findings challenge economic and cultural explanations. The authors suggest a clear distinction b/w these previous theories and the threat from passing refugees, which I find less clear than they suggest
- are there other factors related to distance & refugee attitudes which might confound the relationship? I thought so, but the placebo tests (comparing pre-exposure islands) suggest otherwise
- literature review might be useful, e.g., when they discuss how contact b/w ingroups and outgroups can reduce prejudice if both share equal status and common goals, find themselves in a cooperative rather than competitive environment, and operate under a well-defined set of norms or regulations. Also arguments regarding the role of knowledge, perspective-taking, etc. -> proximity does not necessarily lead to contact!},

  comment       = {overview:
- seven original survey experiments (various US samples) that "randomly assign respondents to receive or not receive accurate information about the prevalence of immigrants before reporting attitudes about immigrants and immigration policy"
- information corrects misperception (i.e., reduces estimated size of immigrant population) but only has little and inconsistent impact on attitudes about immigration
- finding is not consistent with theories of power or intergroup threat (they argue it doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the theory itself, but rather suggests that there may be other cognitive mechanisms that explain why people perceive an out-group as threatening)
- "Misperceptions about the size of minority groups may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of attitudes toward those groups." 

Method:
- survey experiment (estimate foreign born X correct info)
- DV: attitudes towards immigrants, econ/culture threat

Finding:
- correct info doesn't change attitudes but corrects guess
-> misperception of amount is consequence rather than cause of atittudes

Limitations:
- just giving info is not enough, different framing might be more effective

- definition post-truth (Oxford Dictionary 2016): "relating to or denoting circum- stances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping
public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"
-> distinct from the concept of fake news, which involves the deliberate portrayal and pread of false information
-> "foundation for post-truth is laid when people consider opinion to be as legitimate as objective facts, or when they weigh emotional factors as heavily as statistical evidence."

features that characterize post-truth:
- relies on appeals to emotions (fear, anger etc)
- separate fact from specific details of a policy, i.e., feelings about one issue inform debates about an unrelated issue
- repetition is effective
- rebuttals are ignored or dismissed

basic factors used to assess the truth:
- compatibility
- coherence
- credibility
- consensus
- support

environmental factors that exacerbate post-truth:
- overall loss of trust in institutions, including the media
- massive changes in the way we obtain information
-> narratives that are rich with emotion are more persuasive than scientific logic etc.},

The current study investigated whether participants reduce their support of Republican and Democratic politicians when the prevalence of misinformation disseminated by the politicians appears to be high in comparison to the prevalence of their factual statements. We presented U.S. participants either with (1) equal numbers of false and factual statements from political candidates or (2) disproportionately more false than factual statements. Participants received fact-checks as to whether items were true or false, then rerated both their belief in the statements as well as their feelings towards the candidate. Results indicated that when corrected misinformation was presented alongside equal presentations of affirmed factual statements, participants reduced their belief in the misinformation but did not reduce their feelings towards the politician. However, if there was considerably more misinformation retracted than factual statements affirmed, feelings towards both Republican and Democratic figures were reduced—although the observed effect size was extremely small.},
  comment  = {overview:
- misinfo can be corrected, but attitudes don't change unless there is considerable more (fact-checked) misinformation than affirmed factual statements (even then effects are small) -> ratio of misinfo/factual matters
- overall, there appears to be mostly symmetry in how supporters of Trump vs. Sanders react (e.g., both are not able to differentiate between factual statement and misinfo prior to receiving the fact-check, although it should be noted that the Sanders-misinfo is qualitatively different from Trump-misinfo). But: supporters of Trump believed significantly more in Trump misinformation than non-supporters, even after receiving corrective info.
- corrective misinformation did not change participants' view of a politician's general veracity, they are bad at keeping a running tally of inaccuracies

design:
- experiment showing actual statements by Trump/Sanders (some factual, some misinfo), varied the ratio of factual vs. misinfo statements
- atttitudes / beliefs measured pre and post fact-check
- supporter/non-supporter distinction based on feeling-thermometer split
- 2(ratio manipulation)x2(Trump/Sanders)x2(Supporter/non-supporter)x2(pre/post fact check) between-within design
- sample: 1,500 MTurk respondents

comments/questions:
- shows useful examples of how to present corrective information for future experimental designs
- analysis clearly done by psychologist, lots of ANOVAs with three-way interactions
- Q: this study focuses on change in feeling towards source (i.e., the politician making false statement) rather than the change in feeling towards the target (i.e., the object the false statement is about, c.f., Hopkins 2019 JOP). Important difference?},

- Puzzle: why do priorities for combating public risks seem uncorrelated with the dangers those risks objectively present?
- "Americans' risk priorities primarily reflect judgments about the extent to which some victims deserve more protection than others and the degree to which it is appropriate for government to intervene in different areas of social life"
-> "key to understanding Americans' divergent reactions to risk lies more with their values than with their grasp of factual information."

Method:
- Survey asking respondents to complete 15 pairwise comparisons between public risks on multiple dimensions (priority, harm, mortality, fairness, responsibility, disaster potential, long-term growth, worry)
- analysis based on aggregation of individual paired comparisons.

Findings:
- Respondents are well informed about (relatve) magnitude of risks, but those perceptions explained relatively little variation in policy preferences
- Instead, what matters is the relative status of the victim and the appropriate role of government
-> we need to distinguish between factual beliefs and policy preferences, key to productive discourse likely lies in understanding voters' values rather than contesting their factual beliefs. 

Comments/Questions:
- Main priority measure seems problematic: More money than currently or more money than the other risk? The baseline is unclear!
- Accurate relative risk perception does not necessarily imply accurate *absolute* risk perception...},

  abstract  = {We propose a model of motivated skepticism that helps explain when and why citizens are biased‐information processors. Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control, finding strong evidence of a prior attitude effect such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments. When reading pro and con arguments, participants (Ps) counterargue the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias. We also find a confirmation bias—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self‐select the source of the arguments they read. Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization—the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors and highest levels of political sophistication. We conclude with a discussion of the normative implications of these findings for rational behavior in a democracy.},
  comment   = {
Takeaways: 

- Motivated skepticism: people usually accept presented information but begin to question when any contrary evidence is presented. It helps explain when and why there’s biased-information process among citizens.

- In the normative model, collecting and integrating information should be independent form prior belief.

- However, people are more likely to accept/seeking supportive evidence while dismissing contrary evidence to their prior belief. Why? (RQ)

- Theory of motivated political reasoning suggests two motives to reasoning : accuracy goal, and partisan goal (the latter usually considered to drive selective information process and affect-driven motivated reasoning)

- Prior beliefs and attitudes impact on the evaluation of new information and information updating process : prior attitude effect, disconfirmation bias, and confirmation bias

- Conditioning on  attitudes strength and sophistication level, disconfirmation bias and confirmation bias lead attitude polarization. attitudes are more lilkey to be strengthening among those with the stronger priors and higher levels of political sophistication. 


Questions/Comment: 

- These experiments are about evaluation of argument (info) not really about Ps’ own attitude changes 

- Need to test how credibility of info source affect on changes in their attitudes. 
Strength of prior attitudes and sophistication may be entangled},

  comment       = {overview:
- analysis of multiple CCES waves (2006-2014), examines the effect of women candidates and officeholders on political knowledge, interest, and participation
- main argument: most evidence of the effect of descriptive representation on women's empowerment is drawn from surveys from the 1980s and 1990s
- knoweldge: "both men and women are more politically knowledgeable when represented by women in Congress and in state government."
- engagement: "little evidence that women are more politically interested or participatory when residing in places with more female officeholders or candidates"
-> descriptive representation has modest effects on political knowledge among other women, but little unique benefit specifically for women as gender gaps are not reduced
-> little effect on women's interest or engagement in politics
-> potential explanation: changing trends in how people view gender in campaigns, not particularly salient to how women approach campaigns

questions/comments:
- some useful arguments why we should not expect large effects of descriptive representation in current surveys (as compared to past studies)
- to me, the fact that men are similarly affected by women officeholders than men suggests that there might be some underlying confounding factor that is associated with the likelihood of women candidates},

Yet, existing research has largely overlooked the influence of disgust, which is a basic emotion that leads people to avoid contamination threats. We illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions influence political engagement in different ways. This study investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to seek additional information. Thus, disgust has the counterintuitive effect of decreasing public engagement in precisely those situations where it is most critical.},

  comment       = {overview:
- gender differences in political knowledge persist even when using best practices to measure political knowledge
- knowledge gaps are decreased/disappear if respondents receive information

theoretical explanations for gender gap
- gap reflects actual differences, e.g. in resources, education, income...
- knowledge gap is a measurement artifact, e.g. due to guessing, types of questions (no "gender"-issues)
- gender gap exists, but information reduces it -> perspective of the authors

studies:
1) 2 convenience samples (MTurk + Students): present information in seemingly unrelated question, subsequent knowledge question -> compare treatment (no info) with control
2) similar to study 1 with nationally representative sample (YouGov survey)
3) natural information treatment from previous study (medicare and citizenship test)

question:
- does the gender gap disappear simply due to ceiling effects?

comments:
- many good citations and arguments for the knowledge paper
- argues that measurement issue is not sufficeitn to explain gender gap, but it does not directly contradict the measurement argumetn},

  abstract  = {Disagreements over whether polarization exists in the mass public have confounded two separate types of polarization. When social polarization is separated from issue position polarization, both sides of the polarization debate can be simultaneously correct. Social polarization, characterized by increased levels of partisan bias, activism, and anger, is increasing, driven by partisan identity and political identity alignment, and does not require the same magnitude of issue position polarization. The partisan-ideological sorting that has occurred in recent decades has caused the nation as a whole to hold more aligned political identities, which has strengthened partisan identity and the activism, bias, and anger that result from strong identities, even though issue positions have not undergone the same degree of polarization. The result is a nation that agrees on many things but is bitterly divided nonetheless. An examination of ANES data finds strong support for these hypotheses.},
  comment   = {overview:
- social polarization (increased partisan bias, activism, anger) vs. issue polarization
- social polarization is driven by partisan identity and political identity alignment, does not require the same magnitude of issue polarization
- partisan-ideological sorting -> aligned political identities -> activism, bias, anger
- issue polarization is not as strong

hypotheses:
1) Partisan-ideological sorting increases political bias, activism, and anger on an individual level, both via partisan strength and independently of partisan strength, even when issue positions are moderate.
2) The effect of sorting on social polarization is greater than its effect on issue extremity

data/analyses:
- ANES cumulative data set
- measure of partisan-ideological sorting: |pid - ideology| * |pid-4| * |ideology-4| = sqrt((pid-ideo)^2 * sqrt((pid-4)^2) * sqrt((ideo-4)^2) = sqrt((pid-ideo)^2 * (pid-4)^2 * (ideo-4)^2) = sqrt[pid^2-2pidideo+ideo^2]
- sorting had an effect even after controlling for issue extremity
- sorting increased social polarization even after controlling for partisan identity (and holding it constant)

questions/comments:
- where does partisan-ideological sorting come from?
- discuss sorting measure -> it's individual partisan sorting rather than aggregate level sorting
- measure of sorting mixes partisan and ideological identity
- partisan alignment does not require issue extremity, but what about issue alignment?
- differentiation b/w ideological issue position and identity is not really clear
- potential mechanism: partisan identity lower for individuals with extreme policy views
- effect of sorting beyond partisan identity is kind of strange since both measures are so interrelated},

With a multidimensional construct, we are better able to understand the complexities of Americansï¿½ ideological views. This research note presents new survey data from a nationally representative sample of over 2,000 Americans. The survey asks respondents to place themselves on distinct ideological scales regarding social and economic issues, then to prioritize the importance of these issues. The first of its kind to include both ideological preferences and attitude importance, this survey contributes new insights into the complex dimensionality of ideology. Results reveal a plurality of individuals identifying as conservative on both social and economic issues, and a smaller group that is consistently liberal on both policy spectrums. Eleven percent of respondents self-identify as liberal on one scale and conservative on the other, yet choose to identify as ï¿½moderateï¿½ on the traditional unidimensional scale. By analyzing an extensive set of attitudinal and behavioral measures-including vote choice in the 2012 presidential election-this research demonstrates that true moderates are substantially different from those who mix both social and economic beliefs. It further shows that the vast majority of Americans place more importance on economic issues than on social issues, which has greater influence over respondentsï¿½ unidimensional ideological placement as well as their presidential vote choice. This study reveals important consequences of the multidimensional nature of ideology at the mass level.},

- experimental investigation of the role of social context and partisan ambivalence on political preference formation
- ambivalence and heterogeneity have similar but independent effects on reported preferences and the evaluation of policy efficiency
- heterogeneous groups also increase the desire for heterogeneous groups in the future -> I think this is a strange result...

experimental design:
- 2X3: induced ambivalence/univalence X discussion in homogeneous/heterogeneous groups
- discussion of two issues: energy policy and health care policy
- outcome measures: preferred policy choice, evaluate effectiveness of each party's policy, ideal discussion group according to ideological composition

hypotheses:
- univalent partisans -> preference for attitudinally congruent information, more motivated reasoning
- homogeneous group -> more partisan-motivated reasoning + higher perceived effectiveness (and vice versa)

results:
- differences in accordance with the hypotheses, group composition has a strong and independent effect beyond ambivalence
- partisan ambivalence (and heterogeneous groups) prefer more diverse information sources

questions/comments:
- can ambivalence and homogeneity/heterogeneity in social setting be conceptually distinguished?
- comparison b/w first part and second part would be interesting because participants then anticipate the interaction etc.
- people not engaged enough, maybe don't try to convince each other...
- why should respondents in more heterogeneous group prefer more diverse discussion group in the future?
- resuts for college democrats, generalizability might be problematic...
- question about group composition might make participants aware of the experiment etc...

- study shows that public is misinformed about welfare -> obstacle to educating the public with correct facts
- people often are not uninformed about policy, but misinformed: they hold inaccurate factual beliefs, do so confidently, and use it to form preferences
- misinformation leads to diverging collective preferences
- the psychology of misinformation is based on three mental processes that are inherent in human thinking
1) the drawing of social inferences
2) strong drive toward belief and attitude consistency
3) tendency to become overconfident in one's beliefs and judgments

main study:
- survey experiment with 1160 Rs, representative of Illinois residents, 3 randomly assigned groups (group 1 received factual items about welfare, group 2 received a quiz on the same items + confidence measure, group 3 received no treatment at all, then all received the same questions on policy preferences on social welfare)
- findings: widespread mistaken beliefs about the realities of welfare and people holding least accurate beliefs were most confident, factual beliefs and preferences are correlated, but corrective information can be effective if it "hits them between the eyes" (based on smaller student sample!)
- simulations show that misinformation leads to distorted aggregate preferences

new questions for future research:
1) What kinds of factual beliefs about public policy do people have (before they are asked factual questions by an interviewer)?
2) What is the direction of causality between beliefs and preferences? 
3) How widespread is misinformation? 
4) What is the relation between inaccuracy and confidence? 
5) What causes people to be misinformed about political phenomena?
6) Finally, and ultimately of most practical importance, under what conditions can misinformation be overcome?},

- field experiment in Denmark, 2-wave panel with leaflet intervention informing citizens about burglary rates

- conclusion: "Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic."

- theoretical discussion includes a couple of citations to suggest that misperceptions are easy to correct in the lab. check again for literature review

  comment       = {overview:
- question: is polarization a cause of media fragmentation or rather an effect fo media fragmentation? Causal direction is not completely clear in the literature
- major issue in past research: unable to disentangle the effect of selective exposure and actual persuasion
- Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) design, includes free choice and forced exposure of partisan media sources (Fox News, MSNBC, entertainment)
- design allows authors to estimate the degree of polarization caused by selective exposure and the persuasive effect of partisan media, as well as sensitivityanalyses accounting for discrepancies between stated preferences and actual choice
- exposire to more partisan news can sway opinions of even those respondents who are already exposed to some degree of partisan news, but they are most effective among respondents who usually prefer entertainment rather than partisan news
- "We ﬁnd that partisan media can polarize both its regular consumers and inadvertent audiences who would otherwise not consume it, but ideologically opposing media potentially also can ameliorate the existing polarization between consumers."
-> polarization is not simply a function of selective exposure, persuasion effects play an important role as well

comments/questions:
- interesting and useful article that can serve as a template for future persuasion/exposure studies
- design is almost the same as in our lab project implementing a randomized exposure + endogenous exposure design, but we keep the actual content of the news article constant, which could be an interesting extension
- one of their outcome measures is intention to share the news article, this could also be useful for the lab project},

  comment       = {overview:
- proposes a general design for patient preference trials (PPTs) that involves a combination of forced exposure and free choice condition for media exposure experiments
- motivation: "If a treatment has different effects on those who would choose to take it and those who would not, the average treatment effect estimated in a standard randomized controlled trial (RCT) may give a misleading picture of its impact outside of the study sample."
- key causal quantity: ACTE: average choice-specific treatment effect, represents the conditional average treatment effect for the sub-population of subjects who would choose a particular treatment option
- ACTE is identified under (1) randomization of designs, (2) randomization of the forced treatment, and (3) mean ignorability of measurement error (i.e., the discrepancy between stated and revealed preferences is ignorable / not correlated with background characteristics that are associated with potential outcomes
- Assumption 3 is key (and strong in certain contexts), the framework allows for sensitivity analysis of its violation

questions/comments:
- no-design-effect assumption is important, our lab project essentially argues that a nominally identical treatment has different effects on the outcome for the same unit depending on whether the treatment was randomly assigned in the forced exposure condition or voluntary chosen in the free-choice condition -> Essentially we are arguing that this key assumption is violated, which would be an interesting methodological contribution.},

Comments: M-Turk has had a decline in data quality. This article provides three solutions: software to identify fraud in existing datasets, an easy-to-use web application based on this software, and a method for blocking fraudulent respondents in Qualtrics surveys. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening procedure in a third study. Our results suggest that these fraudulent respondents provide unusually low-quality data, but can be easily identified and screened out. An example of how we combat this in our study is that we use VPN in our study to make sure respondents are in the United States.

Comments: This article makes the case that dropping subjects after a post-treatment manipulation check can lead to serious bias and argue for a focus on what is revealed without discarding subjects. They reiterate the well-known result that the intent-to-treat effect is point identified: if subjects are not
discarded, a well-defined causal effect can be estimated consistently. Furthermore, we show that
when the result of the manipulation check does not depend on the treatment, an alternative causal
quantity—the average treatment effect among those who would pass the manipulation check under
all conditions—may be estimated dropping subjects.

  comment       = {observations for the future of political misinformation research:
1) Persistent debates about what constitutes "fake news" and distinctions between other types of false information are mostly distracting: too much attention to definitional issues etc.
2) To what extent does false information actually matter politically? Who is exposed to it, where, and to what effect?: we don't fully understand how frequently people encounter false information in their everyday lives, existing research suggests that exposure may be minimal(!)
3) Exposure and belief in false information depends a lot on our social connections but we haven't paid much attention to that yet: many individuals are likely exposed to misinformation through frineds and family members etc.
4) Politicians, elites, and government officials are major (but understudied) sources of false information
5) Emotions play a critical role in promoting exposure to, engagement with, and belief in misinformation: e.g., much of the political misinformation in curculation plays on negative emotions like anger
6) How do we confront and stop misinformation?

comments/questions:
- a couple of good citations and basic arguments for follow-up projects:
1) examining open-ended responses to evaluate the pervasisveness of misinformation
2) role of social connections in disseminating false information & correct information
3) number of likes etc. as a reputation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of information
4) lack of external validity of many laboratory studies because people do not actively seek out fact-checking messages and rarely encounter them when using social media},

- formal approach to characterize the tension between conclusions people inherently wish to reach (directional motivation) and those which are plausible (accuracy motivation)

- main idea: core beliefs (over which people have a desired conclusion) distort auxiliary beliefs (that people do not care about but that are related to the core belief).
- "The degree to which auxiliary beliefs get distorted is directly tied to how closely related they are to core beliefs" as well as how much the agent cares about his conclusion about the core variable 
-> "Many 'nonrational' ideas about belief formation from psychology that have been applied heavily to political science and economics arise naturally when cast as a maximization problem with accuracy and directional goals."

- presents results from large-scale survey experiments in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, UK, US) to investigate how natives perceive immigrants and how these perceptions influence their preferences for redistribution
- 3 types of treatments: priming-salience, informational, and anecdotal
- great resource for survey items, potential treatments, as well as measures to improve the quality of survey responses, deifnitely worth checking out again vefore designing a survey on this issue (also includes some useful citations of other survey experiments in this area)
- interesting outcome/treatment: assessing people's willingness to pay for correct information about immigration

main findings:
- strinkingly large misperceptions about the number and characteristics of immigrants
- misperceptions are largest among...
- information about the true shares and origins of immigrants is ineffective and mainly acts as a prime that makes people think more about immigrants and reduces their support for redisptribution
-> Negative effect of priming immigration is stronger than the positive effect of correcting misperceptions!
- an anecdote about a "hard working" immigrant is more effective, suggeting that when it comes to immigration, salience and narratives shape people's views more deeply than hard facts},
