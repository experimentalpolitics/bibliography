  comment       = {overview:
- The main question is the impact of factual information compared to framing effects in opinion formation. This is examined in the context of two emergent technologies: carbon-nanotubes and genetically modified foods.
- The authors hypothesize that facts will not have a significantly greater impact than frames without factual information. There are other hypotheses predicting various motivated reasoning effects stemming from the initial framing of the technologies.
- An experiment was administered that assigned several different combinations of frames and facts. A follow-up test was administered at a later date to test the hypotheses concerning motivated reasoning.
- Results indicate that “facts do not enhance frame strength” (p. 681). There is also evidence of biased processing once individuals form their initial opinions.
- Question: Is it possible to present frames without any factual content?
- Question: Is there a first-mover advantage when it comes to framing issues or events?},

  title     = {Does Exposure to the Refugee Crisis Make Natives More Hostile?},
  journal   = {American Political Science Review},
  year      = {2018},
  volume    = {forthcoming},
  pages     = {1--14},
  comment   = {Overview:
- natural experiment + survey on Greek islands affected by influx of refugees from Turkey -> distance from Turkey as instrument for refugee exposure
- "direct exposure to refugee arrivals insuces increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies"
- "since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility"

Method:
- Natural experiment comparing Greek islands that were exposed to refugees vs. islands that were not; distance to Turkish coast was used as an instrument to solve endogeneity issues
- identical survey (N ca. 2000) conducted on multiple islands asking for attitudes, policy preferences and political engagement (multiple items for certain categories combined via PCA), conducted well after refugees left
- 2SLS + various robustness and placebo tests, the analyses seem pretty solid
- potential mechanisms: natives affected by tourism (no) effects determined by predisposition (no, they're pretty uniform)  

Comments:
- in their argument, endogeneity is based on the refugees' decision where to land (i.e., in more "friendly" territory), which does not seem like the only source of endogeneity
- I'm not sure if I buy their argument that the findings challenge economic and cultural explanations. The authors suggest a clear distinction b/w these previous theories and the threat from passing refugees, which I find less clear than they suggest
- are there other factors related to distance & refugee attitudes which might confound the relationship? I thought so, but the placebo tests (comparing pre-exposure islands) suggest otherwise
- literature review might be useful, e.g., when they discuss how contact b/w ingroups and outgroups can reduce prejudice if both share equal status and common goals, find themselves in a cooperative rather than competitive environment, and operate under a well-defined set of norms or regulations. Also arguments regarding the role of knowledge, perspective-taking, etc. -> proximity does not necessarily lead to contact!},
